# carey
Carey [ka´ɾei] animates fonts with CSS &amp; jQuery and some elbow grease. This project is under a research/planning status right now. This is just an idea that I had. Back when Adobe Flash was *in* I created an animated font by manually drawing glyphs vaious times and animating them to randomly change every few milliseconds. Now, I want to have the same effect but on a modern website.

## Tasks:
- [ ] **Create fonts:** I will have to manually create 3 fonts. Each font will be based on a common font and sould be very close to each other to maintain readability.
- [ ] **Add fonts to page:** Using CSS3 I can load and use fonts using `@font-face`. There will be 3 classes (`.carey1`, `.carey2`, `.carey3`).
- [ ] **jQuery Script:** I will need to create a script that assigns a random class to the elements `#carey` every set amount of milliseconds. I will stick to 0.004ms (4 frames per seconds).
- [ ] **Create sample:** I want to show it off, so I will create a sample page to display Carey.
- [ ] **More fonts:** If people like the project, I will  create more fonts. It would be really appreciated if I get some help.
